## Restricting access

You can specify multiple NFTs to restrict product access. There is 1 restriction, however: all of the NFTs for 1 product must be on 1 network. So, you cannot have some NFTs on Ethereum and some NFTs on Polygon for a single product.

However, 2 different products can have NFTs from different networks.

## NFTs

ERC721 NFTs need not have the Token ID field filled in. In that case, the plugin will check that a customer owns any NFTs from a collection.
